/* The OSF/rose half-pic model assumes that the non-library code does
   not need to have full PIC (position independent code), but rather,
   that pointers to external references are put into the data section
   and derefenced as normal pointers.  References to static data does
   not need to be PIC-ized.

   Another optimization is to have the compiler know what symbols are
   in the shared libraries, and to only lay down the pointers to
   things which in the library proper.  */
