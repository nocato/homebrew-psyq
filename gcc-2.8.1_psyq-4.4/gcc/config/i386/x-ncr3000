# Makefile additions for the NCR3000 as host system.

# NCR3000 ships with a MetaWare compiler installed as CC, which chokes and
# dies all over the place on GCC source.  However, the AT&T compiler,
# crusty as it is, can be used to bootstrap GCC.  It can be found in
# /usr/ccs/ATT/cc.  It is also used to compile the things that should
# not be compiled with GCC.

CC = /usr/ccs/ATT/cc
OLDCC = /usr/ccs/ATT/cc

# The rest is just x-i386v4.

# The svr4 reference port for the i386 contains an alloca.o routine
# in /usr/ucblib/libucb.a, but we can't just try to get that by
# setting CLIB to /usr/ucblib/libucb.a because (unfortunately)
# there are a lot of other routines in libucb.a which are supposed
# to be the Berkeley versions of library routines normally found in
# libc.a and many of these Berkeley versions are badly broken.  Thus,
# if we try to link programs with libucb.a before libc.a, those
# programs tend to crash.  To avoid this, we link with libc.a *before*
# linking with libucb.a.

CLIB=-lc /usr/ucblib/libucb.a

# We used to build all stages *without* shared libraries because that may make
# debugging the compiler easier (until there is a GDB which supports
# both Dwarf *and* svr4 shared libraries).

# But james@bigtex.cactus.org says that redefining GCC_CFLAGS causes trouble,
# and that it is easy enough to debug using shared libraries.
# CCLIBFLAGS=-Bstatic -dn -g
